# Salifort Motors Project

## Overview
The goal of the project is to predict whether an employee will leave the company, and discover the reasons behind their departure, they could better understand the problem and develop a solution. Currently, there is a high rate of turnover among Salifort employees. (Note: In this context, turnover data includes both employees who choose to quit their job and employees who are let go). Salifort’s senior leadership team is concerned about how many employees are leaving the company. Salifort strives to create a corporate culture that supports employee success and professional development. 

## Business Understanding
The high turnover rate is costly in the financial sense. Salifort makes a big investment in recruiting, training, and upskilling its employees. If Salifort could predict whether an employee will leave the company, and discover the reasons behind their departure, they could better understand the problem and develop a solution.
